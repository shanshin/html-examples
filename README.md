# html examples

Here are three examples of HTML reports:
- Kover report for a single-module project [](/example1)
- JaCoCo report for a single-module project [](/example2)
- Kover report for a multi-module project [](/example3)

Reports are already generated and placed in [reports](/reports) directory.

To regenerate all reports call CLI command `./gradlew clean koverHtmlReport` in MacOS/Linux or `gradlew.bat clean koverHtmlReport` in Windows CMD.
